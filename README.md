# Abstract

In this presentation, we will look at the how users interface with machines without the use of touch. These different types of interaction have their benefits and pitfalls. To showcase the power of these user interactions we will explore: Voice commands with mobile applications, Speech Recognition, and Computer Vision. After this presentation, attendees will have the knowledge to create applications that can utilize voice, video, and machine learning.

# Description

Users use voice (Alexa, Cortana, Google Now) or video as a mode of interaction with applications. More than a fad, this is a natural interface for users and is becoming more and more common with the ever-decreasing size of hardware. 

Different types of interaction have their benefits and pitfalls. To showcase the power of these user interactions we will explore: Voice commands with two app types: UWP and Xamarin Forms (iOS and Android). Speech Recognition with Cognitive Services: Verifying the speaker with Speaker Recognition API. Computer Vision with Cognitive Services: Verifying a user with Face API.  

By utilizing UWP, Xamarin, and Cognitive services; a device with the ultimate in customization for user interactions will be created. Come and see how!
